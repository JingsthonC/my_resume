<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I am, Jingsthon Castillo. I am web developer aspirant, I may be new in
  this field, but surely I will shake this field.
</p>

<p>
  My experiences were very diversed, but one thing is common, my logic, my
  analyzation skills, and my aim to solve a problem and make things better
  serves as the common denominator of my characteristics.
</p>

<p>
  My philosopy in life is very simple. Do the right thing as a human being. Like
  the Kyocera Philosopy of the late, Mr. Kazuo Inamori. I alwasys intend to be
  an asset to where I will belong to.
